== Install

. Unpack to any directory.
For example, in `$HOME/.sdkm/` (further this path in the documentation will be referred to as
`SDKM_HOME`)
. (Optional) Add the path to `$SDKM_HOME` to `PATH` - if you use hooks, this will be done automatically: `export PATH=${SDKM_HOME}:${PATH}`
. Unpack scripts for shims: `./sdkm reshim`
. Enjoy icon:smile-o[]

== Terminal hooks

. ZSH
+
It is necessary to add the line `source $SDKM_HOME/hook.zsh` to `~/.zshrc`

. Bash
+
It is necessary to add the line `source $SDKM_HOME/hook.bash` to `~/.bashrc`

== SDK installation location

The `{SDK_ROOT_DIR}/{pluginID}/{sdk-version}` directory is used.

By default `SDK_ROOT_DIR` is "${HOME}/sdk". You can set the path via the `SDKM_SDK_ROOT_DIR` environment variable or via the `--sdk-root-dir` argument on the command line (takes precedence over the environment variable)

== SDK caches

Some SDKs use a separate directory for their caches.
For example, in Go it is located in `${GOPATH}`.
By default, the SDKM sets the directory `{CACHE_ROOT_DIR}/{pluginID}/{sdk-version}` for this directory.

By default `CACHE_ROOT_DIR` is "${HOME}/.cache". You can set the path via the `SDKM_CACHE_ROOT_DIR` environment variable or via the `--cache-root-dir` argument on the command line (takes precedence over the environment variable)

== Caching SDK versions

When receiving a list of SDK versions, SDKM caches the received list locally for 1 day to avoid redundant requests to the Internet and improve application responsiveness.

The cache is located in the path `${SDKM_HOME}/.cache/{pluginID}.json`.

It can be forced to update for some commands via the command line argument "--rebuild-cache"
